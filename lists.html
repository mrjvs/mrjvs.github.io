                    <p>New installments in the Legend of Zelda franchise always make me super happy. This time it's a highly
                        stylised version of an older |elda game. From the trailers, it seems to have a dungeon level editor
                        included. It's very exciting; I trust it's going to be great fun.

                        punishing. It's a lot of content for its price but people wanted more. Celeste chapter 7 has over 100 
                        new levels, new music and great level design. It releases quite soon as well.

                    <p>The Stanley parable was an indie game that hit back in 2014. The narration and great humor is what made it so good.
                        The funny way of story telling was good enough to come back to it every year even though I've memorized
                        the entire script by now. The Ultra Deluxe version has more story and more endings. Releases on consoles.

                        release. It went really well when they released on the Nintendo Switch. Team Cherry has released 3 free DLCs and promised
                        another one. But instead of making a new DLC, They made it an entire new game and I couldn't be more happy.

                        for free and still had the amazing charm that Undertale had. New characters, new story, new music and
                        new gameplay. I can't wait for more chapters in the Deltarune series. No release date yet tho.

                        a sequel is perfect. No release date yet, hopefully not another 6 years.

                        that has you engaged until the very last moment. I even went as far to do all of the extra hard levels.

                        The story is about a game developer who Davey (the creator) interprets as struggling mentally. The game is
                         about perspective and forced views. highly recommend it.
